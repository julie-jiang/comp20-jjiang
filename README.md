# Comp 20 Spring 2017 Lab 9
## Julie Jiang (yjiang06)
### Purpose of this Github Rpo
1. Forces us to get into the habit of using Git and Github
2. Serves as a platform between students and instructors so that we can be easily graded on the result of our work *and* the progress of our work

### Favorite lab assignment
I have two: lab 8 (the Heroku one) and lab 7 (the jQuery one). I like these the best because they were the most challenging ones. They required diligence reading and understanding of documentations, which is a very helpful skill every programmer should have.

### Growth from day 1
I have developed a much, much better understanding of JavaScript and its asynchronous programming. For someone who's only dealt with synchronous programming languages, this is a a concept was very obfuscate initially. Now I'm getting more comfortable with this painful async language.

### What I've learned
Async programming, differences between and responsibilities of the client-side and server-side, and non-relational database.

### What I wanna delve deeper into
More JavaScript...
