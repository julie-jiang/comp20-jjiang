# NotUber - The Black Car Service
## COMP 20 2017 Spring Assignment Two
For this assignment, I implemented a pseudo ride-hailing web app with a few APIs including the Google Maps API, datastore API, and JSON API. This web app will display my location, and also display, depending on whether I'm a driver or passenger, either other passengers or vehicles. If you click on any of the vehicles / people, a window containing the user's username and distance from me will pop up.

I correctly utilized all required APIs in order to make this work.

I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone, although I did ask on Piazza for clarification. I also searched Stack Overflow for examples of JavaScript usage. In particular, I frequently referenced [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript) as per suggested in the specs. In addition, I borrowed a lot of Ming's code from his Google Maps API example.

I spent approximately 3 hours working on this project.
