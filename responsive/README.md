# Responsive Design Lab
For this lab, I wrote `responsive.css`, which displays different parts of the image depending on the browser width. 

I did not discuss or collaborate with anyone, although I did ask a question on piazza and frequently referred to [How to use CSS sprites](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) and [Media Queries for Standard Devices](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/), as per suggested in the specs. 

To test my css, I utilized Chrome's developer tool to adjust the viewing width. 

I spent approximately 20 minutes on this lab.
